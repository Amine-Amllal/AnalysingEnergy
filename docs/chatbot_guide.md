- **MWh (Megawatt-hours)**: Total energy over a time period
- **Efficiency (%)**: Generation/consumption ratio × 100
- **Correlation**: Relationship strength between factors (-1 to +1)

### Alert Signals to Watch
- **Recurring deficits**: Risk of service interruption
- **Low efficiency (<90%)**: Sub-optimal system performance
- **High variability**: System instability
- **Negative correlations**: Unfavorable environmental factors

## Best Practices

### Data Quality
- Ensure your prediction data is complete and accurate
- Verify that environmental factors are relevant to your region
- Check for data consistency and realistic values

### Analysis Strategy
- Start broad, then narrow down to specific issues
- Use multiple question types for comprehensive understanding
- Pay attention to temporal patterns and seasonal variations
- Cross-reference environmental factors with energy patterns

### Interpretation Tips
- Look for consistent patterns across different analyses
- Pay special attention to deficit dates for risk management
- Use efficiency metrics to gauge system performance
- Consider environmental factors when planning operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **No response**: Ensure prediction data is properly loaded
- **Incomplete analysis**: Check that required data columns are present
- **Inconsistent results**: Verify data quality and format

### Getting Help
